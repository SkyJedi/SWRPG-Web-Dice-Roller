2.0.0
  Changes:
    -upgrading dependencies; fixing breaking changes
    -functional paradigm used to make components less verbose
    -switched from plain CSS to bootstrap
    -switched popups to bootstrap modals to kick out an outdated dependency
    -switched to SCSS to adjust the default bootstrap theme to make it look closer to the previous App version
    -overhauled the login page form and introduced (opt-in) cookies to remember values
    -migrated deprecated refs-API for react properties
    -everything that's clickable now acts like a button to make it very clear to the user what's interactable
    -all sections can now be minimized to show only the most important information/controls
    -slightly changed the order of the dice to always have a consistent theme in each row
    -messages and chats are color coded
    -message for resetting the destiny pool now contains the previous state
    -rolling brings the result automatically into view; most likely only relevant for small screens, for example on mobile
    -creating and editing a character now happens inside the character block, not inside a separate modal
    -added a few animations
    -added ability to collapse dice results to only show the rolled amount per symbol

  Bugfixes:
    -fixed XSS vulnerabilities - not in the cleanest way possible but for now it has to be 100% backwards compatible
    -two edge cases where undefined fields were accessed
    -initiative tracker now works with a single entry as well
